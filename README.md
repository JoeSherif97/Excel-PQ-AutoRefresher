# Excel-PQ-AutoRefresher
Excel-PQ-AutoRefresher is a PowerShell tool that automatically refreshes all Excel files with Power Query connections, including those in subfolders. It skips files without queries, waits for each refresh to finish, logs all actions, and can be scheduled to run automatically — keeping your data always up to date.
